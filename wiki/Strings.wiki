|| `ToString` || Returns itself. ||
|| `ToNumber` || Tries to convert the string into a number. If it succeeds, it returns the number, otherwise it returns `NaN` (not a number). ||
|| `Unicodes` || Returns the sequence of Unicode characters as a list of numbers. ||
|| `Length` || Returns the number of Unicode characters in the string. ||
|| `Uppercase` || Returns a copy of this string, except all characters that have an upper case version are converted to that form. ||
|| `Lowercase` || Returns a copy of this string, except all characters that have a lower case version are converted to that form. ||
|| `Capitalize` || Returns a copy of this string, except the first character is in upper case if it can be. ||
|| `Uncapitalize` || Returns a copy of this string, except the first character is in lower case if it can be. ||
|| `Left n` || Returns a string with the first `n` characters of this string. ||
|| `Right n` || Returns a string with the last `n` characters of this string. ||
|| `Between l r` || Returns a sub string starting at character `l` and ending just before character `r`. ||
|| `From l n` || Returns a sub string of length `n` starting at character `l`. ||
|| `Less other` || Returns true if this string comes before the `other` string lexicographically. ||
|| `Greater other` || Returns true if this string comes after the `other` string lexicographically. ||
|| `LessEqual other` || Returns true if this string doesn't come after the `other` string lexicographically. ||
|| `GreaterEqual other` || Returns true if this string doesn't come before the `other` string lexicographically. ||
|| `Equal other` || Returns true if the `other` string represents the same sequence of characters. ||
