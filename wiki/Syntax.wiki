= Literals =

== Union ==

The union value corresponds roughly to _null_ or _nil_ in other languages. It is useful if you have no other meaningful value to return (when your functions only purpose is to perform a side effect).

{{
    ()          # The union value
}}

== Booleans ==

Truth value literals matche the regular expression `[01][?]`.

{{{
    1?          # True
    0?          # False
}}}

== Numbers ==

A number literal matches `[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?` and has the obvious corresponding floating point value.
{{{
    20          # The number twenty
    3.141592    # A bad approximation of pi
    1.2e9       # 1.2 billion
}}}

== Strings ==

String literals match `["]([^"]|\\["])*["])` or `[']([^']|[']['])*['])`. Double quote strings can have escape sequences in them (a backslash followed by a code), while single quote strings interpret backslash as an ordinary character. Two single quotes after each other in a single quote string is interpreted as a literal single quote within the string. All strings are in Unicode. Additionally, identifiers that start with a uppercase letter are strings too.

{{{
    "Hello, Funk"  # A text string: Hello, Funk
    "\"Funky\""    # Another string: "Funky"
    'It''s good'   # A third string: It's good
    MyFunString    # The last string: MyFunString
}}}

== !RegExes ==

Regular expressions (actually a superset) start with `~~` and ends with `~~`. In between the last two tildes (`~`) there can be modifier codes. The syntax of regular expressions inside have not been decided yet, but I'll look at Perl when designing them. Suggestions are welcomed.

{{{
    ~~[a-zA-Z]+~~  # Matches any sequence of English letters.
    :f {
        |~~f(o*\=s)bar~~| # Matches foooobar (any number of os) 
                          # and binds the matched os to the s
                          # variable.
    }
}}}

== Lists ==

List literals start with `[` and ends with `]`. Within them are expressions separated by commas, and an optional comma at the end. Automatic semicolons are suppressed if the list parenthesis are the innermost when breaking a line.

{{{
    []             # The empty list
    [1, 2, 3, 4]   # A list of four numbers: 1 2 3 4
    [A, B, ]       # Demonstrating the optional trailing comma.
}}}

== Dictionaries ==

Associative container literals start with `[` and `]` like lists, but the keys are enclosed in vertical bars `| |`.

{{{
    [|]              # The empty dictionary (notice the bar that separates it
                     # from an empty list).
    [|X| 15 |Y| 26]  # The dictionary where "X" maps to 15 and "Y" maps to 26.
}}}
