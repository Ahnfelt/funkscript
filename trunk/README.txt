The Funk Language
===========

Funk is a scripting language that is very simple at it's core: It has
functions (as values), pattern matching and real variables. That's it
- the rest is just nice notation for defining different kinds of
functions - every value is a function. Object oriented programming is
a result of having pattern matching and closures.

It requires OCaml, OCamlFind and extlib.

You can run the example (Test.colo) with:

    make run
    
(you can also just build the compiler with 'make' without the 'run')
